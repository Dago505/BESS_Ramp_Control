# What is BESS Sizing Simulator
A project created to provide computational and theoretical insights in Battery sizing for ramp rate control applications to VRE plants based on the statistical analysis of the output power signals generated by eolic resources as well as power demand time series.
## Objective
The principal objective of the project is the cost-effective sizing of Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) for ramp rate control applications in order to guarantee frequency control of VRE generation. We use a nobel approach for sizing BESS based on the statistical analysis of power output time series to develop a probabilistic model of the Battery response probability density function (PDF) and cumulative density funcion (CDF). With this model, is possible to determine the required BESS power and energy capacity using the 99 percentil of the BESS response CDF as a design rule.

# Usage
The project is currently made of three fundamental blocks: The Synthetic power time series characterization and creation, the BESS response simulation and the numerical and analytical BESS PDF solution based on the statistical information of the power time series and the critical slope that triggers the BESS response.The activation of the BESS for ramp rate control is driven by the critical slope refered as "a" which is determined by the system operator. Additional to this parameter, the next are the following parameters needed to use the Simulation and solvers.
